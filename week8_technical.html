		<h2>What is Rails?</h2>
		<div id="answer">
		<p>Rails, is an open source web application framework which runs via the Ruby programming language. It is a full-stack framework: it allows creating pages and applications that gather information from the web server, talk to or query the database, and render templates out of the box. As a result, Rails features a routing system that is independent of the web server.</p>
		<p>Like many web frameworks, Ruby on Rails uses the model view controller (MVC) pattern to organize application programming.</p>
		<p>In a default configuration, a model in the Ruby on Rails framework maps to a table in a database, and a Ruby file. For example, a model class User will usually be defined in the file user.rb in the app/models directory, and is linked to the table users in the database. Developers can choose any model name, file name or database table name. But this is not common practice and usually discouraged according to the "convention over configuration" philosophy.</p>
