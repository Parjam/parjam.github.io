		<p>The last time I had emotional conflict was with my family. They're concerned and they think they know a better path in my life and I had to respectfully disagree.</p>
		<p>I tried to explain who I am and what's my character and how everything's changed since the time they were young. I am risk taking and maybe they are not. People have different characters and that doesn't mean somebody's right ot wrong. There's no one formula to life.</p>
		<p>After a lot of talking, I think they better accepted the fact that different people, choose different paths. I think only the time will show them and me, what is the better path and what could've been.</p>
		<p>The next time I'll probably do the same. You can try to make everybody happy, but that usually doesn't happen. Everybody has to make their own decisions and then face the consequences!</p>
