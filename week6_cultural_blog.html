		<h1>Stereotype Threat</h1>
		<div id="answer">
		<p>I never been recipient of racial or gender stereotype threat so I don't know what to say about it. Personally I try to be always open minded and not judge people by their gender or race.</p>
		<p>BUT, if everybody thinking you're a dreamer and you can not accomplish your goals falls in stereotype threat category, well I have certainly been there. It puts a lot of pressure on me because I don't want to give up and the stress of failing and not having emotional support when you most need it, is very hard. They may not say it or even say the opposite, but they are actually waiting for you to fail, so they can proudly say they were right. I try to ignore all these things and concentrate on my plans and goals. Even trying to prove them wrong is waste of energy. I just do my thing and they'll understand how wrong they were, eventually.</p>
