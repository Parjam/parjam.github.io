		<h1>What are differences between Ruby and JavaScript?</h1>
		<div id="answer">
		<p>Well each one have their own benefits. JavaScript is a Scripting language which is used in front-end web development while Ruby is back-end language and is used for servers and programs.</p>
		<p>The benefit of JavaScript is being able to have interaction with user within the browsers. The benefit of ruby is very easy to write and its almost like writing in English. Here are two examples of writing a sentence to be displayed in both languages:</p>
		<p><strong>Ruby:</strong> puts "This is a test!"</p>
		<p><strong>JavaScript:</strong> console.log("This is a test!");</p>
		<p>As you can see, the syntax is more complicated in JavaScript and you have to always make sure to put those extra symbols while with ruby is pretty easy and elegant.</p>
