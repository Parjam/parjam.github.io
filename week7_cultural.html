		<h1>Affirmation and Stereotype Threat</h1>
		<div id="answer">
		<p>Thinking about values, is definitely a good exercise to fight stereotype threat. It gives motivation to continue and pass all other problems and think about big picture and what you want to achieve in life. It reminds you, who you are doing it for and how unimportant is other people's assumptions and thoughts.</p>
		<p>I think the other exerise would be having faith in god and yourself. Reminding how perfect he made you and you're the best version of yourself. </p>
