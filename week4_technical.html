		<h1>How to use "map" built-in method on an array</h1>
		<div id="answer">
		<p>Mapping an array is to iterate over an array and, for every value, pass that value to a block and insert the return from the block into a new array. You're "mapping" the values of an array to a new array via a function (the block you passed to the Array).</p>
		<p>So on to a practical example. Say you have an array of symbols, as well as a hash. For each symbol in the array, you want to look up that symbol in the hash and add the value from the hash to a new array. Without using the map method, the code would look something like this.</p>
		<p>names = %w{ Alice Bob }</p>
		<p>scores = { "Alice" => 100, "Bob", 75 }</p>
		<p>scoreboard = []</p>
		<p>names.each do |n|</p>
		<p> scoreboard << scores[n]</p>
		<p>end</p>
		<p>Not very compact. Not very Ruby-like. So let me just show you how it looks when using map.</p>
		<p>names = %w{ Alice Bob }</p>
		<p>scores = { "Alice" => 100, "Bob", 75 }</p>
		<p>scoreboard = names.map{ |n| scores[n] }</p>
		</div>
