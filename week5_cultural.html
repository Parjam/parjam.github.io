		<p>I think the most important problem the tech world is facing, is the old world. Old regulations, old investors and old thoughts of people. They don't realize technology is future of the world and it's going to change everything. There's not enough money in the field to make things happen. People invest after you almost done eveything and already generating revenue.</p>
		<p>The only solution is time. Time will show everybody how important technology is and how it's going to change everything. Even if you don't like change! It's going to make human life easier and more convinient. The future is going to be great.</p>
