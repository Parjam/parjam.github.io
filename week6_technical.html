		<h1>Object-Oriented vs Functional Programming</h1>
		<div id="answer">
		<p>Very roughly speaking, functional programming and object-oriented programming have similar levels of expressive power and similar abilities to encapsulate programs into smaller parts that can be combined and recombined.</p>
		<p>The biggest difference between the two is the relationship between data and operations on the data.</p>
		<p>The central tenet of OOP is that data and the operations upon it are tightly coupled: An object owns its data and it owns the implementation of the operations on the data. It hides those from other objects via its interface, a collection of methods or messages it responds to. Thus, the central model for abstraction is the data itself, hidden as it is behind a small API in the form of its interface.The central activity in OOP is composing new objects and extending existing objects by adding new methods to them.</p>
		<p>The central tenet of FP is that data is only loosely coupled to functions. You can write different operations on the same data structure, and the central model for abstraction is the function, not the data structure. Functions hide their implementation, and the languageâ€™s abstractions speak to functions and they way they are combined or expressed, such as generic functions or combinators. The central activity in FP is writing new functions.</p>
		<p>Good software is written in both styles, because good software has more than one need to satisfy.</p>
