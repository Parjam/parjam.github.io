		<h1>What is pair programming?</h1>
		<div id="answer">
		<p>When two programmers work together on the same code, it's called pair programming. One programmer becomes <strong>Navigator</strong> and the other one, <strong>Driver</strong> and they work on the same computer.</p> 
		<p>It's just like driving a car ...</p>

		<p>In my experience, there are a lot of benefits to pairing. First of all it's super efficient! Hours of work could be done in 30 minutes. You always learn new tricks or material from your pair. The other benefit of it is making the programming even more fun (if that's even possible!). And the last but not least, it makes your mistakes a lot less because your pair would catch them.</p>

		<p>The only challenge I had so far, is managing a time that works best for your pair and yourself. Specially now that everybody's in different time-zone.</p>
		<p>It's always great to receive feedback. It means somebody cares and wants you to be better. Feedback helps you to improve yourself as a programmer and a human. I'm not so good at giving feedback regularly and I usually only give feedback when I have some important things to say.</p>
