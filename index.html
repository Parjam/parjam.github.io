  <h2>About Me:</h2>
  <p>My name is Parjam Davoody. I'm usually not much of a talker unless I find an interesting subject. I always try to keep it simple, like my blog!</p>
  <p>I have a BS in engineering. I always try to make new stuff and work on different startup ideas so I guess that makes me an entrepreneur in progress!</p>
  <h2>Programming Experience:</h2>
  <p>Just the usual stuff from Code Academy and Khan Academy and some online books and materials. Not really much</p>
  <h2>First week challenges:</h2>
  <p>Just moved from Texas to San Fran, and it takes time to settle down and get stuff rolling.</p> 
  <p>I also took some classes and workshops on Digital Marketing, Social Media, Design, and other cool stuff.</p> 
  <p>But now on second thought, I think maybe it was not such a good idea because DBC is a full time job even on phase 0.</p> 
  <p>It's because I want to learn everything.</p> 
  <p>I can manage it and I WILL.</p>
