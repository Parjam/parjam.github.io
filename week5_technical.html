		<h1>Classes in Ruby</h1>
		<div id="answer">
		<p>Ruby is a Object Oriented Programming Language. An object-oriented program involves classes and objects. A class is the blueprint from which individual objects are created. In object-oriented terms, we say that your bicycle is an instance of the class of objects known as bicycles.</p>
		<p>Take the example of any vehicle. It comprises wheels, horsepower, and fuel or gas tank capacity. These characteristics form the data members of the class Vehicle. You can differentiate one vehicle from the other with the help of these characteristics.</p>
		<p>A vehicle can also have certain functions, such as halting, driving, and speeding. Even these functions form the data members of the class Vehicle. You can, therefore, define a class as a combination of characteristics and functions.</p>
		<p>Ruby provides four types of variables:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Local Variables:</strong> Local variables are the variables that are defined in a method. Local variables are not available outside the method. You will see more details about method in subsequent chapter. Local variables begin with a lowercase letter or _.</li>
			<li><strong>Instance Variables:</strong> Instance variables are available across methods for any particular instance or object. That means that instance variables change from object to object. Instance variables are preceded by the at sign (@) followed by the variable name.</li>
			<li><strong>Class Variables:</strong> Class variables are available across different objects. A class variable belongs to the class and is a characteristic of a class. They are preceded by the sign @@ and are followed by the variable name.</li>
			<li><strong>Global Variables:</strong> Class variables are not available across classes. If you want to have a single variable, which is available across classes, you need to define a global variable. The global variables are always preceded by the dollar sign ($).</li>
		</ul>
