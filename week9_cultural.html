		<p>I guess the feedback was most useful, when it was precise and actionable. After receieving a feedback, I'll check to see if it's true or just a misunderstanding. If it was a true issue, I'd try to keep in mind and change differently next time and if it was just a misunderstanding, I'd try to figure out what initialized it and try to avoid it next time. Feedbacks can be positive too. They'll make you understand your strengths.</p>
